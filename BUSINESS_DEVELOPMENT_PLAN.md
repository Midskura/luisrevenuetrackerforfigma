## 🎯 Core Strategy

### **The Critical Decision: Build First or Sell First?**

**❌ DON'T: Build First, Sell Later**
```
Months 1-4: Build complete system (₱200k-500k invested)
Month 5: Launch to market
Month 6: Find out nobody wants it 💀
Result: FAILURE
```

**✅ DO: Validate First, Build Later**
```
Weeks 1-4: Build high-fidelity prototype (₱50k-100k invested)
Weeks 5-8: Pre-sell to 20-30 prospects
Outcome A: 5-10 pay deposits → BUILD IT (validated)
Outcome B: 0-1 pay → STOP & PIVOT (saved ₱400k)
Result: SMART
```

---

### **Why Pre-Selling is the Right Move**

**Traditional Approach (High Risk):**
- Spend 4-6 months building
- Invest ₱200k-500k in time and costs
- Hope customers will buy
- **85% chance of failure** (most products fail)

**Pre-Sale Approach (Low Risk):**
- Spend 2-4 weeks on prototype
- Invest ₱50k-100k in time
- **Prove customers will buy** (they pay deposits)
- Build exactly what they need
- **Launch with customers already waiting**

---

### **The Lean Startup Playbook**

**Phase 0: Prototype** (Weeks 1-4)
- Build clickable prototype (looks real, doesn't work)
- Create sales materials
- Cost: ₱50k-100k in time

**Phase 1: Validate** (Weeks 5-8)
- Demo to 20-30 prospects
- Pre-sell to 5-10 customers
- Collect ₱400k-800k in deposits
- **VALIDATION + FUNDING**

**Phase 2: Build** (Weeks 9-20)
- Now build with confidence
- Customer money funds development
- Customers give feedback during build

**Phase 3: Deliver** (Weeks 21-24)
- Deploy to pre-sale customers
- Collect final payments
- Launch publicly with social proof

---

## 🎁 The Two-Tier Model

### **Offer BOTH: SaaS and Custom Build**

**Why Both?**
- Different customers have different needs
- Some want cheap/easy (SaaS)
- Some want ownership (Custom Build)
- Maximize addressable market
- Test both models simultaneously

---

### **Model A: SaaS Subscription**

**What It Is:**
- Customer subscribes (₱20k-30k/year)
- We host on our infrastructure
- Multi-tenant (shared codebase, isolated data)
- They log in via our domain
- We maintain, update, support

**Who It's For:**
- Smaller operators (50-200 units)
- Budget-conscious customers
- Want easy, low-risk option
- Prefer OpEx over CapEx

**Business Model:**
- Recurring revenue (MRR/ARR)
- Scalable (add customers = minimal cost)
- Higher lifetime value
- Predictable cash flow

---

### **Model B: Custom Build**

**What It Is:**
- Customer pays ₱150k one-time
- We deploy to their infrastructure (their Supabase)
- Single-tenant (dedicated instance)
- They own: code, database, hosting
- Optional maintenance: ₱30k/year

**Who It's For:**
- Mid-size operators (200-600 units)
- Want ownership and control
- Can afford upfront investment
- Prefer CapEx over OpEx

**Business Model:**
- One-time revenue (project-based)
- Big upfront cash
- Optional recurring (maintenance)
- Higher per-customer revenue

---

### **Model Comparison**

| Factor | SaaS | Custom Build |
|--------|------|--------------|
| **Price** | ₱20k-30k/year | ₱150k one-time |
| **Revenue Type** | Recurring | One-time (+maintenance) |
| **Customer Ownership** | No (we own) | Yes (they own) |
| **Our Hosting Cost** | We pay | They pay |
| **Setup Complexity** | Easy (add tenant) | Medium (deploy instance) |
| **Update Management** | Easy (push to all) | Complex (50 instances) |
| **Cash Flow** | Slow (over time) | Fast (upfront) |
| **Lifetime Value** | High (if retained) | Lower (unless maintenance) |
| **Philippine Preference** | Lower | Higher (prefer ownership) |

```
Hi [Name],

I'm building a payment tracking system for real estate 
developers managing 100+ units on payment plans.

Most companies I talk to are losing ₱3M+/year to Excel chaos.

I have a working prototype I'd love to show you (15 min).
Would you be open to a quick demo?

- [Your Name]

P.S. If you know anyone managing Pag-IBIG payments at scale, 
I'd appreciate an intro!
```

---

**The Demo Meeting (45 minutes)**

**1. Problem Discovery (10 min)**

Ask questions (don't pitch yet):
- "How do you track payments today?"
- "What's the biggest pain point with your current process?"
- "How much time does this take per week?"
- "Have you ever missed a payment or had data issues?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would you fix?"

**Listen carefully.** Take notes. This is validation research.

---

**2. Prototype Demo (20 min)**

**Show, don't tell:**
- Pull up the clickable prototype
- **Let THEM click through it** (don't drive)
- Walk through key screens:
  - Dashboard: "This is what you'd see every morning"
  - Unit Detail: "Here's all info for one unit in one place"
  - Payment Recording: "Recording a payment takes 30 seconds"
  - Collections: "System auto-flags overdue units by risk"
  - Customer Portal: "Your customers can pay themselves"

**Ask for feedback:**
- "What do you think?"
- "Would this solve your problem?"
- "What's missing?"
- "If we launch with these features, would you use it?"

---

**3. Pricing & Offer (10 min)**

**Present both options:**

```
We're offering two ways to get this:

OPTION 1: SaaS Early Bird
- ₱20k/year (regular ₱30k)

- ₱5k to reserve your spot today
- Launch in 3 months (March 31)

Which makes more sense for you?

**If interested:**
- "Great! Can I send you the contract today?"
- "Which option - SaaS or Custom?"
- "Can you do the deposit this week?"

**If hesitant:**
- "What would make this a no-brainer for you?"
- "What concerns do you have?"
- "Would you like to think about it? When can I follow up?"

**If not interested:**
- "I appreciate your time. Can I ask - why not?"
- "What would it take for this to be valuable to you?"

2. "What happens when a payment comes in?"
3. "How do you know which units are overdue?"
4. "How long does it take to answer 'What's my balance?' from a customer?"
5. "What's the most frustrating part of your current system?"

**Part 4: Pricing (10 min)**

**Transition:**
- "So those are the key features. What do you think?"
- "Would this solve your problem?"

**If positive response:**
- "Great! Let me show you how to get this..."

**Present both options:**

**Visual comparison table:**
```
                  SaaS             Custom Build
Price:           ₱20k/year        ₱150k one-time
Hosting:         We host          You host
Ownership:       We own           You own
Setup:           3 months         2 weeks
Updates:         Automatic        Optional (₱30k/year)
```

**Ask:** "Which model makes more sense for you?"

**If they choose SaaS:**
- "Awesome. So that's ₱5k today to lock in ₱20k/year rate"
- "We launch March 31, then you pay the remaining ₱15k"
- "Sound good?"

**If they choose Custom:**
- "Perfect. So that's ₱75k deposit to start your build"
- "We deliver in 4 weeks, then you pay the final ₱75k"
- "Want to get started this week?"

---

**Part 5: Close (5 min)**

**If ready to buy:**
- "I'll send you the contract today"
- "Can you do the deposit this week?"
- "Any questions before I send it?"

**If hesitant:**
- "What concerns do you have?"
- "What would make this a definite yes?"
- "Would you like to discuss with your team?"
- "When should I follow up?"

**If not interested:**
- "I understand. Can I ask - what's holding you back?"
- "Is it price, features, timing, or something else?"
- "What would it take to make this work for you?"

**End positively regardless:**
- "Thanks for your time"
- "I'll send you the demo video and proposal anyway"
- "Feel free to reach out if anything changes"

---

### **Objection Handling**

**Objection 1: "This is too expensive"**

**Response:**
"I hear you. Let me ask - how much are you losing to late payments and Excel errors per year?"

[They'll say: "I don't know" or "Maybe ₱500k-1M"]

"Right. Most companies your size lose ₱3M-5M per year to payment tracking issues. If this system improves your collection rate by just 5%, that's ₱3M recovered. Our ₱150k is paid back in 3 weeks."

**Alternative:**
"Let me put it another way. You're spending 20 hours/month on Excel work. That's ₱960k-1.8M per year in your time alone. Our system costs less than 2 months of your time."

---

**Objection 2: "We need to think about it"**

**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. Can I ask - what specifically do you need to think about? Is it price, features, timing, or something else?"

[They'll tell you the real objection]

Then address that objection directly.

**If genuine need to discuss with team:**
"Makes sense. When are you meeting with your team? I can send you a summary to share with them. When should I follow up?"

---

**Objection 3: "We're fine with Excel"**

**Response:**
"I respect that. Can I ask - how long does it take you to answer when a customer calls asking 'What's my balance?'"

[They'll say: "5-10 minutes" or "I have to call them back"]

"Right. And how many of those calls do you get per week?"

[They'll say: "10-20" or whatever]

"So that's 2-3 hours per week just answering balance questions. With our customer portal, customers can check their own balance 24/7. That alone saves you 150 hours per year."

**Then:**
"Excel works for calculations. But it's terrible for payment lifecycle management. No automation, no reminders, no customer portal, prone to errors. You're using a hammer to tighten a screw - it works, but there's a better tool."

**Objection 4: "Can we try it first?"**

**Response:**
"Great question! We're offering three ways to de-risk this:

1. **This demo** - You're seeing the actual product right now
2. **Money-back guarantee** - If we don't deliver by March 31, full refund plus ₱5k
3. **Small deposit** - Only ₱5k to reserve (not ₱30k upfront)

The early bird rate is only available for the first 10 customers. If you wait until we launch, it's ₱30k/year with no discount."

**Alternative:**
"Think of the ₱5k as a risk-free reservation. If we don't deliver, you get ₱10k back (refund + penalty). You literally can't lose."

---

**Objection 5: "We tried software before and it didn't work"**

**Response:**
"I hear that a lot. Can I ask - what software did you try and why didn't it work?"

[They'll tell you: too complex, too expensive, didn't fit workflow, etc.]

**Address their specific pain:**

**If "too complex":**
"I totally get it. That's why we built this specifically for Philippine real estate. If you can use Excel, you can use this. It's actually simpler - no formulas to debug."

**If "too expensive":**
"What was the price? [They say ₱100k-300k/year] Right, enterprise tools are crazy expensive. We're ₱20k/year for SaaS or ₱150k one-time for custom. Much more affordable."

**If "didn't fit our workflow":**
"That's exactly why we're offering custom build. We configure it for YOUR workflow. Plus you're seeing it now - does this fit your process?"

---

**Objection 6: "We don't have budget right now"**

**Response:**
"When does your budget reset? [They say: "January" or "April"]

"Perfect. We're launching in March anyway. Let me put you on the early bird list for ₱5k. When your budget comes in, you'll save ₱10k/year with the locked-in rate."

**Alternative:**
"I understand budget is tight. Let me ask - how much do you think you're losing to late payments right now? [They estimate]

"Right. So this isn't a cost, it's an investment that pays for itself in the first month. Can we find ₱5k in this quarter's budget to lock in ₱10k annual savings?"

---

**Objection 7: "I need to talk to my business partner"**

**Response:**
"Absolutely. Would it help if I joined that conversation? I can do a quick 15-min demo for both of you."

**If they say no:**
"No problem. Let me send you a summary deck you can share. What's the best way to present this to them? And when are you meeting?"

**Set follow-up:**
"Can I follow up with you next [day of week]? I'll check in to see what they think."

---

**Objection 8: "What if you go out of business?"**

**Response (for SaaS):**
"Fair question. Two things:
1. You can export all your data anytime - Excel, CSV, PDF. Your data, your ownership.
2. We're pre-selling to fund development. Your deposits prove demand. We're not going anywhere."

**Response (for Custom Build):**
"Great question - this is actually why custom build is perfect for you. YOU own the code, the database, the hosting. If we disappear tomorrow, your system keeps running. You're not dependent on us."

---

**Objection 9: "We're building something in-house"**

**Response:**
"Interesting! How far along are you?"

[If early stage: "Just planning" or "Hired a developer"]

"Gotcha. How much is it costing? [₱300k-500k]

"And timeline? [6-12 months]

"Right. So you're investing ₱300k-500k and waiting a year. Our custom build is ₱150k and delivered in 4 weeks. Even if you still want to build in-house later, this gets you running NOW while you plan that."

**If far along:**
"That's awesome. How much have you spent so far? When's the launch date?"

[They'll reveal it's over budget or behind schedule]

"Yeah, custom dev is tough. If your project gets delayed, we're here as a backup. Want me to check back in [3 months]?"

---

**Objection 10: "Can you add [specific feature]?"**

**Response:**
"Great idea! Let me ask - is that a must-have for you, or nice-to-have?"

**If must-have:**
"We're gathering feature requests from early customers. If 3+ people ask for the same thing, we build it. Let me add this to the list. Would you still get value from the core features we showed?"

**If nice-to-have:**
"Cool, I'll add it to the roadmap. We launch with core features first, then add based on customer feedback. Does that work?"

**For custom build:**
"Since you're doing custom build, we can add that as a customization. It would be ₱20k-50k extra depending on complexity. Want me to scope it out?"

|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| **Strong** | 10+ | ₱800k+ | BUILD - Validated |
| **Good** | 5-9 | ₱400-750k | BUILD - Validated |
| **Weak** | 3-4 | ₱200-375k | MAYBE - Pivot pricing |
| **Fail** | 0-2 | ₱0-150k | STOP - No demand |

**Secondary Metrics:**

**Meeting Conversion:**
- Target: 50% of meetings → interested
- Target: 50% of interested → deposit

**Objection Patterns:**
- Track most common objections
- Adjust pitch to address them

**Feedback Themes:**
- Which features do they care about most?
- Which features are "meh"?
- What's missing?

---

### **Build Phase Metrics (Weeks 9-20)**

**Development Velocity:**
- Target: Complete Phase 1 by Week 12
- Target: Complete Phase 2 by Week 16
- Target: Complete Phase 3 by Week 20

**Customer Engagement:**
- Open rate on bi-weekly emails: >50%
- Response rate to feature feedback: >30%
- Customer satisfaction (survey): >8/10

---

### **Launch Metrics (Week 24)**

**For Custom Build Customers:**
- Target: 100% deployed by Week 22
- Target: 100% final payments collected
- Target: 80% buy maintenance contracts (₱30k/year)

**For SaaS Customers:**
- Target: 100% onboarded by Week 24
- Target: 100% final payments collected
- Target: 0% churn in first 90 days

---

### **Year 1 Financial Targets**

**Conservative Scenario (5 customers total):**
```
Custom Build:
- 3 customers × ₱150k = ₱450k
- 2 maintenance × ₱30k = ₱60k

SaaS:
- 2 customers × ₱20k = ₱40k

Total Year 1: ₱550k
```

**Target Scenario (10 customers total):**
```
Custom Build:
- 6 customers × ₱150k = ₱900k
- 5 maintenance × ₱30k = ₱150k

SaaS:
- 4 customers × ₱20k = ₱80k

Total Year 1: ₱1.13M
```

**Stretch Scenario (15 customers total):**
```
Custom Build:
- 8 customers × ₱150k = ₱1.2M
- 7 maintenance × ₱30k = ₱210k

SaaS:
- 7 customers × ₱20k = ₱140k

Total Year 1: ₱1.55M
```

---

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

### **Risk 1: Not enough meetings booked**

**Mitigation:**
- Start outreach in Week 4 (before materials are perfect)
- Cast wide net (30+ contacts)
- Use multiple channels (LinkedIn, referrals, events)
- Offer valuable content (free Excel template) to get in the door

**Fallback:**
- Extend sales phase to Week 10 if needed
- Adjust build timeline accordingly

---

### **Risk 2: People interested but won't pay deposit**

**Mitigation:**
- Make deposit small (₱5k for SaaS)
- Generous refund guarantee (builds trust)
- Create urgency (only 10 spots, price going up)
- Social proof (X spots already taken)

**If this happens:**
- Ask WHY (price too high? don't trust? need more time?)
- Adjust offer based on feedback
- Consider payment plan (₱2.5k now, ₱2.5k in 2 weeks)

---

### **Risk 3: Can't deliver on time**

**Mitigation:**
- Add 50% buffer to timeline (promise March 31, aim for Feb 28)
- Follow PLAN.md religiously (don't scope creep)
- Weekly progress check (am I on track?)
- Cut features if needed (launch with MVP, add later)

**If you're falling behind:**
- Communicate early (Week 15, not Week 20)
- Offer extension + bonus (extra month support, discount on Year 2)
- Worst case: Refund + keep relationship

---

### **Risk 4: Build wrong features**

**Mitigation:**
- Demo prototype in sales (they see what they're getting)
- Ask: "If we launch with THESE features, would you use it?"
- Bi-weekly updates during build (show progress, get feedback)
- MVP mindset (core features first, nice-to-haves later)

**If feature requests pile up:**
- "Great idea for Phase 2!"
- "If 3+ customers ask, we'll build it"
- Offer as paid customization (₱20k-50k)

---

### **Risk 5: Customer gets cold feet before launch**

**Mitigation:**
- Stay engaged (bi-weekly emails, monthly videos)
- Show progress (screenshots, demos)
- Ask for input ("Which color scheme?")
- Build excitement (countdown to launch)

**If someone wants refund:**
- Ask why (genuine feedback)
- Offer to delay (keep deposit, launch later)
- If adamant: Refund graciously, keep relationship

---

### **Risk 6: Reputation damage if you fail**

**Mitigation:**
- Only take deposits you can refund (don't spend it all)
- Set aside 50% for refunds (safety net)
- Be transparent (this is pre-sale, we're building)
- Underpromise, overdeliver

**If you have to shut down:**
- Refund everyone immediately
- Apologize sincerely
- Explain what happened
- Offer to help migrate to alternative
- Your reputation survives if you handle it with integrity

---

### **Risk 7: Technical issues during demos**

**Mitigation:**
- Test prototype before every demo
- Have backup (demo video if live fails)
- Use stable internet
- Screen record prototype as fallback

**If prototype breaks mid-demo:**
- "Ah, demo gremlins! Let me show you the video instead"
- Laugh it off, stay professional
- Follow up with working demo later

---

## 📝 Templates & Scripts

### **Outreach Email Template**

Subject: Payment tracking for [Company Name]?

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] manages [X] units/properties. 

I'm building a payment tracking system specifically for 
Philippine real estate companies managing 100+ units on 
payment plans.

Most companies I talk to are losing ₱3M+/year to Excel chaos 
(missed payments, data errors, no automation).

I have a working prototype I'd love to show you - 15 minutes.

Would you be open to a quick demo this week?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's a 5-min video preview: [link]

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

### **Do's:**

✅ **Start with prototype, not full build** (validate first)  
✅ **Make deposit small and refundable** (lower risk)  
✅ **Be transparent about timeline** (underpromise, overdeliver)  
✅ **Stay engaged with pre-sale customers** (bi-weekly updates)  
✅ **Ask for feedback constantly** (build what they need)  
✅ **Offer both SaaS and Custom** (maximize TAM)  
✅ **Create urgency** (limited spots, price going up)  
✅ **Generous guarantees** (builds trust)  
✅ **Listen more than talk** (discovery is key)  
✅ **Follow up relentlessly** (fortune is in the follow-up)  

---

### **Don'ts:**

❌ **Don't build before validating** (biggest mistake)  
❌ **Don't oversell** (only take deposits you can refund)  
❌ **Don't promise unrealistic timeline** (add 50% buffer)  
❌ **Don't go silent after deposit** (engagement crucial)  
❌ **Don't scope creep** (stick to MVP, defer features)  
❌ **Don't argue with objections** (understand them)  
❌ **Don't burn bridges** (even if they don't buy)  
❌ **Don't forget to follow up** (most sales need 5-7 touches)  
❌ **Don't take it personally** (rejection is data, not judgment)  
❌ **Don't give up after 5 meetings** (need 20-30 for valid test)  

---

## 🏁 Success Criteria

### **Phase 0-1 Success = 5-10 Paying Customers**

**If you achieve this:**
- ✅ Validated demand (people will pay)
- ✅ ₱400k-800k in deposits (funds development)
- ✅ Customer feedback (know what to build)
- ✅ Social proof (testimonials, case studies)
- ✅ Confidence to build (not blind hope)

**Proceed to Phase 2: BUILD IT**

---

### **Phase 0-1 Failure = 0-2 Paying Customers**

**If you don't achieve this:**
- ❌ No validated demand (or wrong market/price)
- ❌ Minimal revenue (can't fund build)
- ❌ Unclear product-market fit
- ❌ High risk to continue

**DO NOT proceed to full build. Instead:**
1. Analyze why (price? features? market? timing?)
2. Pivot based on feedback
3. Test again (different price, different market)
4. If still no traction: STOP (you just saved ₱500k+)

---

## 📅 Timeline Summary

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Goal | Revenue |
|-------|----------|-------|------|---------|
| **Phase 0** | Weeks 1-4 | Prototype + Materials | Demo-ready assets | ₱0 |
| **Phase 1** | Weeks 5-8 | Validate + Pre-Sell | 5-10 deposits | ₱400k-800k |
| **Phase 2** | Weeks 9-20 | Build + Update | Complete system | ₱0 (building) |
| **Phase 3** | Weeks 21-24 | Deploy + Launch | Deliver + collect | ₱580k-920k |
| **Year 1 Total** | 24 weeks | Validate → Build → Launch | 10 customers | ₱980k-1.62M |

---

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

### **This Strategy Works Because:**

1. **Validates demand BEFORE investing heavily**
2. **Customer money funds development** (no need for investors)
3. **Build exactly what customers need** (based on feedback)
4. **Launch with customers already onboarded** (Day 1 revenue)
5. **Minimize risk** (if no demand, you stop early)
6. **Maximize learning** (20-30 demos = market research gold)

---

### **The Alternative (Don't Do This):**

Build for 6 months → Launch → Crickets → Fail

**vs**

Pre-sell for 2 months → Build for 3 months → Launch with customers → Success

---

## ✅ Decision Point

**After Week 8, you'll know:**

**Option A: 5-10 deposits collected**  
→ **BUILD IT** (validated demand, funded development)

**Option B: 0-4 deposits collected**  
→ **PIVOT OR STOP** (weak/no demand, don't build)

---

**Either outcome is GOOD:**
- Option A = You found a business
- Option B = You avoided ₱500k mistake

**Both are wins.**

---

## 🚀 Next Action (Right Now)

**Answer these questions:**

1. **Can I commit 4 weeks to build the prototype?** (Yes/No)
2. **Can I commit 4 weeks to demo 20-30 prospects?** (Yes/No)
3. **Do I have ₱60k-150k to invest in this test?** (Yes/No)
4. **Am I okay with "no" (if market doesn't validate)?** (Yes/No)

**If all YES → Let's build the prototype this week.**

**If any NO → Let's discuss what's holding you back.**

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 27, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to Execute
