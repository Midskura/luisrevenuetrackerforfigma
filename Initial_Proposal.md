1. Executive Summary


EL Construction manages the construction, sale, and post-occupancy operations of ~600+ housing units and more. The current spreadsheet-driven workflow makes it difficult to:

Replace spreadsheet process with a single source of truth for ~600+ units.
Track the entire unit lifecycle: inventory → reservation → move-in → payment cycle → fully paid.
Detect payment risk early (amortization + utility/other dues) and avoid long-overdue accounts.
Give leadership daily visibility (portfolio, cashflow, risk) and give staff clear follow-ups.

Nexsys Solutions proposes a custom housing lifecycle management system built around your exact workflow, designed to solve these blind spots with:

Real-time unit status tracking and lifecycle views.
Automated payment lifecycle monitoring with late/at-risk flags.
Property management dues integration (optional).
Alerts for late or at-risk accounts (optional).
Clear dashboards for management (portfolio, risk, collections)

This is not an ERP and not a template system—it is a custom internal operations platform tailored to EL Construction.

2. Current Challenges (Identified)

Limited visibility across 600+ units - Spreadsheets cannot show status distribution, payment risks, upcoming payments, or units needing immediate follow-up; issues surface late.

Payment drift & missed collections - Homeowners can fall behind without detection, causing unrecoverable arrears, bad projections, and slow response.

Separate property management workflow - Utilities/garbage/maintenance dues are tracked manually and separately; overdue balances can go unnoticed for months.

Leadership lacks a unified view - No instant view of sold vs at-risk units, collections performance, or where issues are building.

3. Proposed Solution

Custom Housing Lifecycle System - A unified platform designed around EL Construction’s operations.

A. Unit Inventory & Lifecycle Tracking

Digitize all units with fields such as Block/Lot, Unit Type, Selling Price, Buyer/Homeowner, Move-in Schedule, Payment Terms, Property Management Status.  

Lifecycle: Available → Reserved → Move-in Scheduled → Move-in Confirmed → In Payment Cycle → Paid on Time / Late / At Risk → Fully Paid.  

Status updates driven by real events—reduces manual cross-checking.

B. Payment Lifecycle & Collections Module

Track amortization (typically 1–2 year monthly schedule), expected vs paid, days late, arrears tally, next due date, and per-unit payment timeline.
  
Automatic alerts/flags: upcoming due, missed payment, X days late, “Critical” for high-risk accounts (thresholds to finalize).

C. Property Management Module (Optional)

Separate from amortization. Track utilities (water, electricity), garbage, maintenance, misc. charges, payment history, and overdue indicators to prevent long-running debts.

D. Management Dashboard

Unit overview: units by lifecycle stage, in payment cycle, fully paid, occupied vs vacant.  

Risk overview: late payments, at-risk accounts, property management overdue list.  

Collections overview: expected vs actual, short-term cashflow projection, payment distribution.

E. Data Export & Compatibility

CSV/Excel exports anytime.  

Data structures aligned to your current masterfile for transparency, reporting, and backups.

F. Automated Notifications (Optional Add-On)

Email/SMS reminders: payment due, payment overdue, utility/dues reminders (uses external provider; fees separate).

4. Migration Strategy

Migrate current state only (buyer details, payment terms, months paid, arrears, next due date, utility dues, current status). The system continues the lifecycle from that point forward—clean and avoids historical inconsistencies.
5. Daily Workflow After Digitalization

Before (Spreadsheet)  

Manual cross-checking, no alerts, hard to view 600 units, late discovery of issues, separate files for property management, slow reporting, no payment timelines, error-prone.

After (Nexsys System)  

Collections: due today, late, approaching danger; log payments; add notes; dashboard of all units.  

Property Management (if enabled): utility/dues overview, unpaid bills, alerts for prolonged nonpayment.  

Leadership: instant portfolio view, risk heatmap, cashflow projections, monthly collection summary, unit status at a glance.
6. System Architecture (High-Level)

Web-based (desktop + mobile-friendly) on Next.js + Supabase (managed cloud), daily backups.  
Role-based access (Admin/Staff/Viewer baseline).  
Data export anytime (CSV/Excel). Client owns all data.  
Cloud hosting is the default. On-prem/private hosting is available but quoted separately.

7. Project Timeline (Estimate)

Phase 1
Blueprint Refinement & Data Mapping: 1 week.
Phase 2
Build: 3–4 weeks (modules, dashboards, automations).
Phase 3
Testing & Migration: 0.5–1 week (import sample data, UAT).
Phase 4
Training & Handover: 0.5–1 week (live demo, quick guide, 14–30 days bug-fix window).  
Total
~5–7 weeks depending on revisions and add-ons.
