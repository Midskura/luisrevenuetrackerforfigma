Hi Elliot!
We build custom systems for PH SMEs that automate sales, inventory, accounting, and receivables — all in one place.
One transaction log updates everything automatically.
No more manual spreadsheets.
If you want to see how this works for EL Construction & Development Group, we offer a free workflow audit.

They need inventory module. That’s it. Inventory + dashboard.

They build housing units (research what type) but he mentioned pagibig loans. The chairman’s main problem is (oh and they are using spreadsheets mainly!) their “inventory” items are housing units. And their “mark as sold” is when the initial payment comes in, and the house owner moves in but he said that’s not the end of it because after they move in they still have stepped-collection amount (im not sure what for) spread over 1-2 years (monthly?) and the same applies to ~600 units. What im getting is they need a unit status tracker + inventory. Their problem is vision. I would need more information on data structure but i think that’s a good starting point for an initial blueprint. Another thing they mentioned is that they want a separate status tracking for the property management side when the housing gets occupied, like what the property manager charges for utility bills, or other dues. They emphasized this is a separate thing from the housing payment status because the pain is that when they find out about a problem when it’s already too late, for example imagine one homeowner actually has not been paying electricity for almost a year already, even if this happens just 2% of the time then that would be catastrophic and probably irreversible because the homeowner wont be able to pay anymore. What they probably want is a way to see like “woah this is starting to start to look bad, fix it”
They also asked if it’s possible to automatically notify their (clients/homeowners) when a payment is due or if a system that detects if the payment is late then it will automatically send an email? Or a way to notify them. (I think they just manually hit up the homeowner to collect)

I asked them about their sheets process, they really just have one masterfile, once it’s paid they update the status to paid. That’s it. I feel like their main problem is what comes after.

Here’s what I told them (some of it unintentional? idk): everything they said is possible. I assured them that whether it’s 30 or 600 units it wont be a problem once we lock in that shape or lifespan of just 1 single unit (they said the same shape applies to every unit, not like each unit is different kinda thing but I’m not sure if they understand it), the amount of units would not be a problem, we just have to find a way to make them see above all those units. They also asked where the data will be stored, I told them it’s online on an enterprise-grade database provide called supabase, told them it’s safe and secured but (this one I dont know why i said) I said that if ever they want a physical server in house that’s also possible but that requires a different setup. Also told them about the auto email thingy that if the unit and homeowner data is paired up properly, that’s is entirely possible but it would come with different costs as the email provider service is an external service that we can integrate. After some awkward what now moments, Anthony mentioned if it’s possible to see project status because they are in construction to see progress. I said yes. Then later on I closed, I said I’d have to scope everything out first then send them an initial blueprint but I said that will surely need revisions because I need more info on their current data structures, or data shapes, and their exact step by step processes. I mentioned the timeline, back and forth revisions of the blueprint, once approved 50% then delivery 50%. They agreed, no flinching at the price (now im starting to think this might be too low), and now they are waiting.
