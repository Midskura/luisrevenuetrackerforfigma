Below is a clean, founder-ready breakdown document that gives you a full mental model of:
what to promise,

what NOT to promise,

what counts as “standard,”

what must be scoped separately,

what’s included in support,

how to avoid oversights,

and how premium dev shops protect themselves.

This is the document most agencies WISH they had when starting.

📘 Nexsys Solutions — Delivery & Service Framework (Internal Reference)
A complete breakdown of scope, terms, standards, and risk protections

1. Standard Project Structure (Your Baseline)
   These are the default modules included in a typical 2–4 week project.
   This is what “standard workflow” means.
   Included by default
   Dashboard & KPIs (cashflow, sales, inventory, receivables)

Accounting Ledger (sales, expenses, transfers, collections)

Inventory Module (availability, cost basis, tags)

Receivables Module (AR logging, repayments, write-offs)

Transactions Quick Entry (simple input logic)

Reports Lite (CSV exports)

User Roles: 1–3 basic users (Admin, Staff, Viewer)

Mobile-friendly UI (not full mobile app)

Rebrand + Their business name

Simple automations (e.g., auto-update balances)

This is your core engine, which is already built.

2. What’s NOT Included (But Can Be Added)
   This is the “boundary layer” that protects you from getting eaten alive by scope creep.
   ⚠️ Not included unless explicitly scoped
   (Meaning: charged separately, requires new timeline)
   POS system

Barcode scanning system

Multi-warehouse, multi-branch

Complex approval workflows

BIR integrations

CRM, HRIS, Payroll

Manufacturing module (batches, yields, BOM)

Delivery routing, fleet management

E-commerce integrations (Shopify, Shopee, Lazada)

Automated invoice generation

Deep analytics dashboards

APIs or integrations with third-party platforms

OCR scanning (unless you want to add Nexsys Receipts later)

Offline mode

Multi-language

Custom database-level security policies

24/7 hotline support

These are advanced and must be quoted separately.
The moment someone requests something beyond your ready-made engine, you say:
“We can do that — let me scope it and send the timeline.”

3. Project Lifecycle (Default Process)
   Phase 1 — Discovery Call (Free)
   Understand business workflows

Identify pain points

Evaluate “standard vs advanced”

Show demo with your system

Purpose: qualify if they’re a fit.

Phase 2 — Workflow Audit (Free)
Deliverables:
Workflow map

List of needed modules

Timeline (2–4 weeks for standard)

Final quote

This is your strongest sales weapon.

Phase 3 — Agreement & Payment
Your standard terms:
50% upfront

50% on launch

Timelines only start after upfront payment

Extra modules priced separately

You can offer optional:
70% upfront, 30% after 2 weeks

Installment plan (but only for friend/family)

Phase 4 — System Build (2–4 weeks)
Each week is predictable:
Week 1
Client data model mapping

Set up their dashboard, ledger, inventory

Quick entry rules + cashflow calculations

Basic UI rebrand

Simple workflow logic

Week 2
Receivables

Reports

Adjust workflow logic

First live demo + tweaks

Optional Week 3–4 (if needed)
More refinement

More automation rules

Additional features

Phase 5 — User Training
Provide:
45-minute live demo

Tutorial message pack

PDF short guide

3–7 day period for questions

THIS is where most competitors fail — so overdeliver here.

Phase 6 — Launch
Deploy to their custom domain

2–4 weeks of adjustment

4. Aftermarket Support (Post-Launch)
   You need fair terms so clients don’t abuse your time.
   Free Support (included)
   14–30 days of bug fixing

Minor changes (text changes, rename fields)

Basic technical support

Uptime monitoring

Small workflow tweaks

⚠️ Paid Support
Monthly retainer (₱3,000–₱15,000 depending on business size) covers:
Feature requests

UI restructuring

Advanced automations

Custom reports

Extra integrations

24–48 hour support replies

⚠️ Emergency Support
Charged separately:
Urgent same-day changes

Urgent bug fix caused by client misuse

Damage caused by client editing the database

5. Boundaries on Data & Privacy
   You must protect yourself here.
   Your rules:
   All client data belongs to the client

You only access data with permission

You give them export tools (CSV)

You do NOT guarantee recoverability if they delete data

You do NOT handle their taxes or compliance

6. Pricing Strategy (Internal)
   Standard 2–4 week system
   → ₱18k–₱60k depending on scope
   → YOUR sweet spot is ₱30k–₱45k
   Optional modules:
   POS module: ₱15k–₱40k

Multi-branch inventory: ₱15k–₱25k

Analytics dashboard: ₱20k+

Shopee/Lazada/Shopify: ₱25k–₱40k

CRM: ₱10k–₱30k

Monthly retainers:
₱3,000 basic

₱7,500 mid

₱15,000 full support

This gives you room to scale without burning out.

7. Red Flags — Projects You Should Reject
   These clients will destroy your time:
   ❌ Client doesn’t know their own workflow
   ❌ Client wants full POS + ERP + CRM for ₱10k
   ❌ Client wants a mobile app
   ❌ Client keeps changing requirements
   ❌ Client has unrealistic deadlines
   ❌ Client wants to “copy a competitor’s entire system”
   ❌ Client says “bahala ka na, ikaw na bahala diyan”
   Say:
   “Your needs exceed our standard scope. We can do it with a custom quote.”

8. Your Safeguard Lines (Must memorize)
   When client adds new requests:
   “Sure — is this a new requirement or a priority change?
   If it’s new, I’ll quote it separately.”
   When client wants vague features:
   “How does this workflow look in real life? Walk me through it step-by-step.”
   When client keeps changing mind:
   “Let’s pick the version you want for Phase 1. The rest goes to Phase 2.”
   When client wants a big promise:
   “Most standard setups go live in 2–4 weeks.
   Complex workflows may take longer depending on scope.”

9. What Counts as Project Completion
   You need a clear endpoint to avoid infinite revisions.
   A project is complete once:
   All modules agreed upon in the Workflow Audit are delivered

Client can log sales, expenses, inventory, and receivables

System is stable

Training has been done

Bug fixes for 14 days are ongoing

Clients often confuse:
Infinite improvements vs Phase 1 completion

So write in your contract:
“Project ends once Phase 1 deliverables are met.
Enhancements beyond Phase 1 are quoted separately.”

10. How to Protect Yourself From Scope Creep
    Never say “yes” immediately

Always reply with:
“Let me check if it’s within scope.”

Keep a simple spreadsheet tracking their requests

Mark each as:
✔ included
✖ add-on

Don’t link modules too tightly so changes don’t cascade

Don’t promise integrations until you validate feasibility

Don’t let them request more than 2 revisions per screen
